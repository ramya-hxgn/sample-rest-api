These divestments will allow Hexagon&#8217;s SIG division to focus on its core software portfolio, particularly its fast-growing public safety business, ahead of the potential separation of Octave.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most of the purchase is by Bart &amp; Associates (B&amp;A), which has acquired several business assets out of Hexagon US Federal, including IT services supporting the US Federal market, geospatial data production services, and the supply of ruggedized hardware for enabling cyber assurance and situational awareness.

Most of the products sold in these businesses are not sold elsewhere across Hexagon.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2024, the divested businesses contributed around 90 MUSD in revenues in total, with a level of profitability in line with similar services businesses.

Share Programme 2025\/2028 includes a maximum of approximately 2,000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group. Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards free of charge that may entitle to Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2025 until 31 December 2028 are fulfilled, where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period, with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2025\/2028. The target level for the performance-based condition shall be an increase in the company&#8217;s earnings per share during the financial year 2028 compared to the financial year 2024. If the target level is achieved, the participants shall be entitled to receive Series B shares in the company in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2025\/2028. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2028.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Share Programme 2025\/2028 is estimated to comprise maximum 5,333,000 Series B shares in total, which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company. To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2025\/2028, the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice, under which the third party shall, in its own name, acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2025\/2028. Provided that the performance condition is fully met, the total costs for Share Programme 2025\/2028 is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million, allocated over the vesting period.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The AGM resolved to authorize the Board of Directors to, on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting, resolve on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time. Transfer of shares may be made at a maximum of ten per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash, through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the authorizations is to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value, to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares, and to ensure the company's undertakings, due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs), including social security costs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on issues of shares, convertibles and\/or warrants<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The AGM resolved to authorize the Board of Directors during the period up until the next AGM to, on one or more occasions, with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, and with or without provisions for contribution in kind, set-off or other conditions, resolve to issue Series B shares, convertibles and\/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization, the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization. The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above, is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies, part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company&#8217;s capital base and equity\/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders&#8217; preferential rights, issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above, the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further information, please contact:<br \/>Tom Hull, Head of Investor Relations, +44 (0) 7442 678 437,&#160;<a href=\"mailto:ir@hexagon.com\">ir@hexagon.com<\/a><br \/>Anton Heikenstr&#246;m, Investor Relations and Business Analyst, +46 8 601 26&#160;26,&#160;<a href=\"mailto:ir@hexagon.com\">ir@hexagon.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The information was submitted for publication at 19:00 CET on 5 May 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><em>Hexagon is the global leader in precision technologies at any scale.

          "body":"<p>Hexagon AB today announced an agreement to acquire the Unified Communications Radio Suite (UCRS) software assets of CONET Communications GmbH (CCOM), part of CONET Group, to complement its public safety platform. <\/p>\n\n<p>UCRS is a high-performance communication solution for control centres capable of integrating diverse channels such as Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and mobile phone networks, digital radio, business information systems, public address systems, video surveillance (CCTV), video conferencing, and satellite communication infrastructures. Combining UCRS with Hexagon's public safety platform will provide agencies with a fully integrated command-and-control solution from one vendor. Successful customers such as the Kassel Fire Brigade already benefit from the combined Hexagon and CONET offering. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Seamless communication is an essential part of emergency response. Public safety agencies must be able to communicate with responders in a variety of ways, making the addition of CCOM's product suite a natural extension of Hexagon's technology stack,\" said Norbert Hanke, interim President and CEO, Hexagon. \"This acquisition strengthens our ability to serve public safety customers today while accelerating innovation for the future.\" &#160;<\/p>\n\n<p>CCOM's UCRS solution, supported by around 50 employees, will be reported within Hexagon's Safety, Infrastructure &amp; Geospatial division and is expected to generate revenues of around ~10 MEUR in 2025 with margins similar to SIG averages. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is expected to be finalised by the end of Q2 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For further information, please contact:<\/strong><strong>&#8239;<\/strong><br \/>\nTom Hull, Head of Investor Relations, Hexagon AB,&#8239;+44 7442 678 437,&#8239;<a href=\"mailto:ir@hexagon.com\" target=\"_blank\">ir@hexagon.com<\/a>&#8239;&#160;<\/p>\n<div><\/div>",

          "summary":"",
          "body":"<p>Following a good start to the year, Hexagon has recorded a weaker than expected financial performance in March, which is the most significant month in the quarter for revenues. Growth in the key NAFTA and China markets declined in the last two weeks of March, with economic uncertainty impacting deliveries. Recurring revenues grew strongly during the quarter, but this was more than offset by weakness in sensor sales. The decline in sensor volumes in March, coupled with a 6 MEUR drag from currency transaction effects, had a negative short-term impact on EBIT1 margins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Preliminary reporting indicates revenue of approximately 1,322.8 MEUR in Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: 1,299.9 MEUR), corresponding to organic growth of 0% (Q1 2024: 3%) for the group. Reported growth will be around 2%, with both currency and structure contributing 1% each. EBIT1 (operating earnings excluding adjustments) for the group is expected to be approximately 345 MEUR (Q1 2024: 376.5 MEUR), resulting in an adjusted operating margin of around 26.1% (Q1 2024: 29.0%).<br \/><br \/>The management team is closely monitoring the current uncertainty in end markets, and if demand continues to be impacted actions will be taken to address the cost base of the group accordingly. A further update will be provided in the Q1 2025 report.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hexagon will release its Q1 2025 report on Wednesday 30<sup><\/sup>April 2025 at 08:00 CET.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For further information, please contact:<\/strong><strong>&#8239;<\/strong><br \/>\nTom Hull, Head of Investor Relations, Hexagon AB,&#8239;+44 7442 678 437,&#8239;<a href=\"mailto:ir@hexagon.com\" target=\"_blank\">ir@hexagon.com<\/a>&#8239;&#160;<br \/>\nAnton Heikenstr&#246;m, Investor Relations Manager, Hexagon AB, +46 8 601 26&#8239;26,&#8239;<a href=\"mailto:ir@hexagon.com\" target=\"_blank\">ir@hexagon.com<\/a>&#8239;&#160;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This information is information that Hexagon AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
